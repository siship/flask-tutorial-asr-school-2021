  - Methods: ```GET```, which pulls data from a server, and ```POST```, which pushes new data to a server.
  - URL (Uniform Resource Locator) - An address for a resource on the web, such as ```https://realpython.com/python-web-applications/```. 
  - A URL consists of a protocol (```https://```), domain (```realpython.com```), and optional path (```/python-web-applications/```).
  - This is my request - ```https://realpython.com/python-web-applications/``` [base URL + path]
